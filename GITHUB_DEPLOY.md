# üöÄ Quick GitHub & Vercel Deployment

Your code is ready! Follow these **5 simple steps** to deploy:

---

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `acsa-prep-tool`
   - **Description**: `AI-powered education leadership prep tool`
   - **Visibility**: Public
3. Click "**Create repository**"
4. **STOP** - Don't initialize with README (we already have files)

---

## Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub (1 minute)

Copy and paste these commands **one at a time**:

```bash
cd /c/Users/MarieLexisDad/pai/projects/acsa-tool

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/acsa-prep-tool.git

git push -u origin master
```

**Replace** `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!

4. On Vercel dashboard, click "**Add New**" ‚Üí "**Project**"
5. Find `acsa-prep-tool` in the list
6. Click "**Import**"
7. Vercel will auto-detect settings - just click "**Deploy**"

---

## Step 4: Add Your API Key (CRITICAL!)

1. While deployment is running, click "**Environment Variables**" tab
2. Add new variable:
   - **Key**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `your-openai-api-key-from-platform-openai-com`
   - **Environments**: Check all three boxes (Production, Preview, Development)
3. Click "**Save**"
4. Click "**Redeploy**" to apply the environment variable

## Step 5: Share with Your Wife! üéâ

## üîí Security Reminder

3. The old key is still in `server.js` on your computer - that's fine, just don't commit it!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "Requires authentication" when pushing to GitHub
- Solution: Run `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email "your@email.com"`

**Problem**: API calls fail on deployed site
- Solution: Make sure you added `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in Vercel and clicked "Redeploy"

**Problem**: Site loads but looks broken
- Solution: Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R) to clear cache
